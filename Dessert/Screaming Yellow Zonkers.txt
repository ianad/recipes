Screaming Yellow Zonkers

sugar		1 cup
butter		4 tablespoons 
corn syrup		1/2 cup 
water		1/2 cup 
salt		1/2 teaspoon 
vanilla		1/2 teaspoon
popcorn		1 1/3 bags butter-flavored microwave 

1. Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, water and salt in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring the candy to 265-275 degrees, or what is known as the hard
ball stage, using a candy thermometer. If you
don’t have one, drip the candy into a small glass of
cold water. If the candy forms a very hard, yet slightly pliable
ball, you’re there. Watch your mixture closely so that it
doesn’t boil over.

2. While candy cooks, pop both bags of popcorn and spread about 2
quarts or 1 1/3 bags of popcorn 
on one large or two small cookie sheets. Put the popcorn in your
oven set on its lowest temperature. This will keep the popcorn hot
so that the candy will coat better.

3. When your candy has reached the hard ball stage, add the vanilla.

4. Pull the popcorn from the oven and, working quickly, pour the
candy over the popcorn in thin streams. Mix the popcorn so that
each kernel is coated with candy, put the popcorn back into the oven
for five more minutes, then stir once again. This will help to coat
each kernel. You can repeat this step once more if necessary to get
all of the popcorn coated. Pour popcorn onto a large sheet of wax
paper to cool. Spread the popcorn out, but be careful…it’s hot.

5. When popcorn is cool, break it up and immediately put it into a
tightly sealed container, such as Tupperware. This will ensure that
it stays fresh. This stuff gets stale very quickly in moist climates
if left out.

Makes about 4 quarts.
