January 3, 1999

In Spanish, the exact translation for ropa vieja is old clothes, because this is how shredded beef looks.  Ropa Vieja is a traditional Cuban dish. 
  

A Traditional Recipe 

3 1/2 pounds pot roast 
salt and pepper to taste 
1/4 cup olive oil, divided 
1 cup of water 
1 large onion, sliced 
2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed 
1 green bell pepper, chopped 
1 cup of tomato sauce 
1 teaspoon salt 
2 bay leafs 
1/2 cup of dry white wine 

Rub the meat  with the salt and pepper.  In a large pot brown the meat on all sides in a little bit of the olive oil.  Add one cup of water.  Cover and simmer until the meat is tender, about 2 hours.  If the pan dries out during cooking add more water.  When cooked, allow the meat to cool in the pan, sitting in its own juices.  When cool, shred the meat with you fingers and set aside along with any remaining pan juices. 

In the same pot heat the remaining olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic, until the onion is translucent.  Add the green pepper and sauté some more.  Add the remaining ingredients, including the shredded meat and juices.  Cover and simmer on low heat for 20 minutes. 

Remove the bay leaves, they are a choking hazard and serve with rice or a salad.

A Somewhat Updated Recipe 

2 pounds of skirt or flank steak 
1 medium onion, cut in quarters 
1 large onion, thinly sliced 
3 cloves of garlic finely chopped 
1 clove of garlic peeled and crushed 
1 large green bell pepper 
3 large ripe tomatoes finely chopped (about 1.5 pounds) 
2 tablespoons dry sherry 
2 bay leaves 
2 tablespoon cumin 
salt, pepper, hot sauce to taste 
1/4 cup of olive oil 
1/3 cup pimentos and capers for garnish 

In a large stock pot place the meat.  Add  enough water to cover the meat.  Add the onion quarters, crushed garlic, and salt and  pepper if desired.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce the heat to medium.  Cook until the meat is tender, about 75- 90 minutes.  When tender, place the meat on a plate and refrigerate until cool to the touch. 

Shred the meat with your fingers.  If it doesn't come apart easily pound it a few time with a meat mallet, and the next time you make this dish cook the meat for a longer period of time. 

In a LARGE skillet heat the olive oil.  Over high heat, add the chopped garlic and stir fry one minute or until lightly brown.  Reduce the heat to medium and add the sliced onion and green peppers.  Stir fy until tender, about 10 minutes. 

Add the remaining ingredients except the meat.  Raise the heat slightly to a medium high and cook for about 25 minutes.  Stir occasionally.  Remove the bay leaves, the little stalks are a choking hazard.  Add the shredded meat and continue to cook until the meat is heated, about 5 minutes.  Add the garnish if desired. 

Serve with rice and beans.
