Grilled Lobster Tail

Ingredients :
2 8oz to 10oz lobster tails
4 tablespoons butter
1 garlic clove
1 lemon
salt and pepper

First things first
If the lobster tails are frozen, start by thawing them to room temperature by placing them in a plastic bag and then submerge them in a warm bowl of water.

Prepare Basting Sauce
Next create a basting sauce. Melt the butter in a small dish in the microwave, or warm in a small pan and remove from heat. Mince the garlic or use a garlic press to mince the garlic and add to warm butter. Add one tablespoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice and stir.

Halve the tail
Lay the tails bottom side up on a cutting board. Using a large knife, cut the tails in half length-wise. Use kitchen scissors to get all the way through the shell if you need to. Using a brush, thoroughly baste the flesh side of the tails with the butter mixture.

Prep the grill
Clean and oil the grate to prevent sticking. Using a gas grill, turn the grill to medium-high heat. For charcoal, distribute the coals so there is an even heat.

Grilling lobster tails
Once the grill is hot, give the lobster tails one last baste, add a bit of salt and pepper and place them flesh side down on the hot grill. Be careful of flare-ups from the dripping butter. Cook flesh side down for 4 to 5 minutes until light grill marks show. Flip the lobster tails to shell side down. Baste with the butter mixture several times during the next 3 to 6 minutes until the lobster meat is firm and opaque.
