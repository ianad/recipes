olive oil		3/8 C
lemon juice	1/4 C (two lemons)
soy sauce		3/8 C
worcestershire	1/8 C
mustard		1/8 C
salt		1 t	
pepper		1/2 t
garlic		1 clove

Marinate for 2 to 3 hours per inch and grill to no more than medium. On the thick roasts you will want to grill it directly for about 2 minutes per side then grill indirectly for about 30 minutes.

Grill steak about 4 to 5 minutes on each side

The internal temperature should not pass 130 degrees F. Allow thinner cuts to rest for about 5 minutes and whole roasts to rest for 10 minutes. Resting allows the meat to relax and the juices to flow back into the meat. Carve the London Broil cross grain and serve.

It's great on mashed potatoes
